I've been told that I'm \"easy to talk to.\" I work best with individuals who are struggling with shame cycles and difficulty breaking out of patterns keeping them stuck - stuck in relationships, stuck in emotions preventing healing, stuck in unhealthy patterns, etc. We will make sense of your history, change the narratives that might be causing you suffering, and work to create a new story that allows authentic flourishing.",
            "While I pull from various therapeutic modalities (see below), my clinical approach is most impacted by psychodynamic theory, attachment frameworks, trauma-informed care, and a focus on the relationship between client and therapist. As your therapist, you will experience not only clinical support, but a genuine relationship that I believe paves the way for lasting change."
